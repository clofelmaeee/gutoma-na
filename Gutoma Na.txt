- Vite - React - CSS

- Gutoma Na (GN) is a vibrant website that showcases delicious food and inviting local spaces, offering people a place to unwind, relax, and enjoy a great atmosphere. I built the static landing page for Gutoma Na using React.js and JavaScript, styled it with CSS, and deployed it on Vercel for a fast and reliable user experience.
